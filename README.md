# Zara-chatbot-recommendation


<p>
  This was a project that I worked on to be an extension of IBM Watson Chatbot where I implemented a function to scrape real data of shirts from zara.com(zara.com). The Chatbot will then recommend users the attire that they want to look for. I implemented the code in IBM functions under the same account.
